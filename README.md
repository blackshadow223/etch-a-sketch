# etch-a-sketch
This is the **fourth** project of TOP. Honestly, this project doesn't seem like it will turn out to be good, mostly because the concept feels foreign to me for some reason. In any case, my goal is to finish TOP and learn as much as possible.

### Time for self-reflection
At first, I had no idea what a "Etch a Sketch" even is. But after researching, I still couldn't figure out how I was supposed to make a toy like that (one that I never played to begin with and had no experience with). So I took a peek at others solutions, and it looked both easy and difficult depending on what perspective I took. Therefore I, again, implemented a simple UI with simple javascript code. The goal was to finish the end product as exactly described by the requirements from TOP.

One more problem, I messed up git commits again. Forgot to commit. Didn't commit often enough. And commit messages are vague.

All in all, I am not satisfied with the end product. Actually, I feel like I fumbled big time! But that's nearly not enough to stop me from learning more!
